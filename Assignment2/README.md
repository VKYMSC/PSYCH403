This is my set of answers to Assignment 1:

**1. Print exercises** [yourname.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py).

(2) There are variables showed up in the Variable Editor as the picture above.

**2. Operation exercises** [Operation_Exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Operation_Exercises.py).

(1) The outputs are the same for these and shown as the picture above. <br />
(2) The modulo operator gets the remainder of the division.<br />
(3) ** is the exponentiation operator and gets the exponential result of the first number. For example: 1** 3= 1* 1* 1. <br /> // is the floor division which round to the nearest smallest integer. For example: 1//3 = 0. <br />
(4) The python follows the order of operations. As in the format "a+b+c * d/e", python calculates multiplication and division first, and addition next. 

**3. Variable exercises** [yourname.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py). <br />
(2) No variables showed up. Because I didn't "print" anything.  <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169676-cb035806-6eb6-44f4-b602-0cbebaa7707b.png"> <br />
(3) No repeated letters in my name: <br /><img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169764-6077ebba-d3b4-48b8-a993-583cefbf6e16.png"> <br />
There's no problem with two different variables having the same value. <br />
(5) The X variables changes and the other variables remains the same.<img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169904-732532ce-4cf3-438f-9363-d6a326041aed.png"> <br />
(6) <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192171425-a11ec122-5115-4dd2-bdd1-6a7aba927d02.png"><br />
Changing the value of "letter1" does not change the value of "letterX". Because you just re-assign letter1's value to a new string called "z", and the "letterX" just copy the string of the original "letter1" and will not change to the new "letter1's" string. Python variable assignment can be covered if you re-assigned the variables with a new value; however, the "copied" string will remain the same. 
    
**4. Boolean exercises** [Boolean_exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Boolean_exercises.py) <br />
(1) 1 and 1.0 are equivalent because they're both "integers"; "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent because the two "strings" are not the same.<br />
(2) 5 and (3+2) are equivalent.<br />
(3) <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192172919-cb247abb-4da3-49ed-a74a-43307d69803d.png">

**5. List exercises** [List_exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/List%20_exercises.py)<br />
<img width="687" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192174573-2557d709-a671-4af7-aefb-06bb83b30711.png"> <br />
(1) The oddlist becomes a variable. <br />
(3) The length of the list is 5. <br />
(4)The type of oddlist is "list". <br />
(6)The list prints the integers from 0 to 100. <br />

**6. Dictionary exercises** [Dictionary_exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Dictionary_exercises.py)
<img width="687" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192174987-34f78fff-e29d-4f83-837f-0b33c9e84463.png"> <br />
(3) Python determines the length of a dictionary by determining the number of paired objects in the dictionary.

**7. Array exercises** [Array_exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Array_exercises.py) 

<img width="687" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192176915-1a24fe64-340d-44ec-a04c-0bea81e99e87.png">
(1) The result returns to a list of floats. <br />
(2) The result returns to a list of strings. The results return to the type of last item in the array in Python. <br />
(1-4) The results printed in the picture above.
