This is my set of answers to Assignment 1:

1. Print exercises [yourname.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py).

(2)There are variables showed up in the Varible Editor as the picture above.

2. Operation exercises [Operation_Exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Operation_Exercises.py).

(1) The outputs are the same for these and shown as the picture above. <br />
(2) The modulo operator gets the reminder of the division.<br />
(3) ** is the exponentiation opertator and gets the exponential result of the first number. For example: 1** 3= 1* 1* 1. <br /> // is the floor division which round to the nearest smallest integer. For example: 1//3 = 0. <br />
(4) The python follows the order of operations. As in the format "a+b+c*d/e", python calcuates multiplication and division first, and addition next. 

3. Variable exercises [yourname.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py). 
(2) No varables showed up. Becasue I didn't "print" anything.  <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169676-cb035806-6eb6-44f4-b602-0cbebaa7707b.png"> <br />
(3) No repeated letters in my name: <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169764-6077ebba-d3b4-48b8-a993-583cefbf6e16.png">
There's no probelm with two different variables having the same value. <br />
(5) The X varibles changes and the other variables remains the same.<img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192169904-732532ce-4cf3-438f-9363-d6a326041aed.png">

    Changing the value of "letter1" does not change the value of "letterX". Because you just re-assign letter1's value to "z", and the "letterX" just copy the value of the original "letter1" and will not change to the new "letter1" value. Python varible assignment can be covered if you re-assigned the varibles with a new value; however, the "copied" value will remain the same. 
    
4. Boolean exercises [Boolean_exercises.py](https://github.com/VKYMSC/PSYCH403/blob/main/Assignment2/Boolean_exercises.py) <br />
(1) 1 and 1.0 are equivalent because they're both "integers"; "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent because the two "strings" are not the same.<br />
(2) 5 and (3+2) are equivalent.<br />
(3) <img width="593" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43455460/192172919-cb247abb-4da3-49ed-a74a-43307d69803d.png">
